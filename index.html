            <h2 id="header">Hi! I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ray-kong-89113425a">Ray Kong</a>!</h2>
            <p id="blurbinfo">I am a rising senior at Brooklyn Technical High School, and a current All Star Code Scholar!
                I enjoy being active, which includes playing handball and basketball. Being active keeps me feeling refreshed and that energy transfers to other facets of my life.
            </p>

            <h2 id="header">What are my future aspirations?</h2>
            <p id="blurbinfo">I find that I have an affinity toward the technical and logical, which explains my interest in STEM,
                especially technology and mathematics. I love using the technical and logical to produce creative projects, showing my
                 need for a balance between creativity and logic.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="header">What am I doing now?</h2>
            <p id="blurbinfo">As mentioned before, I am currently an All Star Code Scholar, where I am expanding my coding knowledge
                by learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I am also serving as the Junior Director of Public Relations at TeenHacks LI,
                a hacker community that hosts hackathons in Long Island.
